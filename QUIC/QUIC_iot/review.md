mqtt + QUIC. using QUIC for IoT. compare MQTT/TLS/TCP vs MQTT/QUIC with ns-3 simulator. There are papers existing to assess simple QUIC performance for iot, MQTT with QUIC & TCP. They shows possibility for QUIC performance for Iot scenario. But according to this paper, there don't exist many works addressing the evaluation of QUIC in IoT scenarios. Results shows QUIC with Iot has

This Paper presents QUIC with "go" based language. QUIC can easily change enoughly competitiveness

- Discuss the positive aspects

QUIC-go is provided to open-source.

- Idntify contradictions, gaps, and inconsistencies in the text

This paper just test in emulated situation, using ns-3. There isn't any real-world test.
